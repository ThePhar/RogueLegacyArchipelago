# Rogue Legacy Randomizer for Archipelago

This project is based of the decompiled and cleaned source code by Cellar Door Games. This project makes some quality of life improvements and adds randomization via the Archipelago service
by the [Archipelago Community](https://archipelago.gg).

## Installation

In order to run Rogue Legacy Randomizer you will need to have Rogue Legacy installed on your local machine. Extract the Randomizer release into a desired folder **outside** of your Rogue Legacy install. Copy the following files from your Rogue Legacy install into the main directory of your Rogue Legacy Randomizer install:

- DS2DEngine.dll
- InputSystem.dll
- Nuclex.Input.dll
- SpriteSystem.dll
- Tweener.dll

And copy the directory from your Rogue Legacy install as well into the main directory of your Rogue Legacy Randomizer install:

- Content/

Then copy the contents of the CustomContent directory in your Rogue Legacy Randomizer into the newly copied Content directory and overwrite all files. 

**BE SURE YOU ARE REPLACING THE COPIED FILES IN YOUR ROGUE LEGACY RANDOMIZER DIRECTORY AND NOT REPLACING YOUR ROGUE LEGACY FILES!**

You should be good to run RogueLegacyRandomizer.exe! You will also need to generate a game at https://archipelago.gg to create a new game.
